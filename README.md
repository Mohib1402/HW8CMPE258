## 🧠 Overview

This assignment is divided into **four major parts**, focusing on building deep computer vision models with supervised contrastive learning, various transfer learning techniques (images, video, audio, NLP), zero-shot learning using CLIP, and SOTA image models on standard datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and X-Ray/3D medical scans.
