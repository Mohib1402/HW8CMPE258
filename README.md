## üìå Assignment Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Part 1: Supervised Contrastive Learning
- Dataset: CIFAR-10
- Comparison between:
  - Traditional Softmax classifier
  - Supervised Contrastive Learning with frozen encoder + classifier
- Visualizations: t-SNE, Accuracy Curves, Confusion Matrix

---

### ‚úÖ Part 2: Transfer Learning (Multimodal)
- **Image**: Transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 (feature extraction + fine-tuning)

- **Video**: I3D model from TensorFlow Hub with a custom uploaded video

---

### ‚úÖ Part 3: Zero-Shot Transfer Learning
- Used OpenAI‚Äôs CLIP model for image-text matching
- Explored BigTransfer (BiT) with flower classification dataset
- Demonstrated zero-shot and fine-tuned classification workflows

---

### ‚úÖ Part 4: Vision Classifiers (Multiple Datasets)
- Implemented classifiers for:
  - MNIST
  - Fashion-MNIST
  - CIFAR-10
  - X-ray Pneumonia detection
  - 3D CT Scan classification
- Models used:
  - EfficientNet
  - BiT (BigTransfer)
  - MLP-Mixer
  - ConvNeXt-v2
